# Answers to Technical Questions
1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment
    1. I spent around half a day on the coding assignment. If I had more time I would prioritize making the app responsive across different devices.
    1. I would focus more on the UI and try to make it more intuitive  
2. The addition of arrow functions to JavaScript has really changed the way I     think about coding. Writing simple one-liners rather than convoluted functions really improves the readability of the code. I feel that combining this with ternary operators can really increase coding efficiency as well. An example where I have used this is:
`const sortedBooks = books.sort((a, b) => sortedAZ ? b.title.localeCompare(a.title) : a.title.localeCompare(b.title));`
3. Tracking down performance issues is not something that I have a lot of experience with however the first and foremost step would be perform a code review with your team to try to track down the issue. Having a full understanding of the data usage and where any bottlenecks might come from can then be narrowed down by using test cases.
4. I would describe the Open Library API as very simple and straightforward to use. I did not have any issues in sorting the results as per the needs of the app and feel that it was one of the easier APIs that I have worked with. However, if I was to improve anything, I would say that the documentation is not very thorough. I feel that there should be more endpoints limit results to only specific key, value pairs so the size of the data returned can be more efficient.
